Professional Portfolio &amp; Blog

This is a work in progress that will be my professional portfolio, showcasing my skills, knowledge, languages, and projects. It will also feature a blog to document my self-taught journey and things I learn along the way.

I'll be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript at first, and eventually React.
