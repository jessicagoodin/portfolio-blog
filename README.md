Professional Portfolio &amp; Blog

EDIT: Still learning here, don't judge!

I'm beginning a new repo and titling it different so that I can use .github.io to host it. It's currently exactly the same as this one, so this one won't see any updates unless I want to start messing with it. Thanks! 

This is a work in progress that will be my professional portfolio, showcasing my skills, knowledge, languages, and projects. It will also feature a blog to document my self-taught journey and things I learn along the way.

I'll be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript at first, and eventually React.
